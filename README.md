# Dopameme-CMS-Project

CMS Project that was completed back in Fall 2017.

The goal of this was to create a content management system that allowed users to read and post blogs on a website.

The website implemented login verification, dynamic posts and comments that would update with back end tools such as PHP and MySQL.
